<p>This is the project where I had to use my Grid knowledge</p>
<p>Although I used flex more than grid, I somewhat understood how to work with grid, and how to combine flex with grid.</p>
<p>My classes have started, so I can't give time on TOP like I used to, but still, I making good progress.</p>

<p>I finished this project in <b>28 days</b> to finish. I started this on <b>24 February</b> and finished it on <b>22 March</b>.</p>
